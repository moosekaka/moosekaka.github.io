### A little about me ###

I did my undergraduate at [Imperial College](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/) in Mechanical Engineering. I then worked for several years as a business analyst at [Tuas Power](http://www.tuaspower.com.sg/), Singapore. I decided to return to graduate school in Biomedical Engineering at the University of California, Irvine. I graduated with my PhD under the supervision of [Susanne Rafelski](http://www.rafelski.com/susanne/Home.html) in 2015.

My PhD research was focused on creating a framework to study structure and function relationships in budding yeast. I implemented my project using mainly Python, together with commonly used scientific packages available in this language (such as Numpy, Scipy, Pandas etc.). 

I am also comfortable in interfacing with hardware (in my lab I am responsible for maintaining the proper functioning of the spinning disk confocal microscope platform). With my engineering background I am able to handle the electronics, mechanical and computational issues that regularly crop up in my project.
