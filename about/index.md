# A little about me
I grew up in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia and did my undergraduate at [Imperial College](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/) in Mechanical Engineering. I then worked for several years as a business analyst at [Tuas Power](http://www.tuaspower.com.sg/), Singapore. I decided to return to graduate school in [Biomedical Engineering at UC Irvine](http://engineering.uci.edu/dept/bme). I graduated with my PhD under the supervision of [Susanne Rafelski](http://www.rafelski.com/susanne/Home.html) in 2015.

Coming from an engineering background, I tend to take a practical approach to academic research. This means that I like to use modular tools that get the job done as quickly and correctly as possible. I prefer to utilize open source tools that result in [reproducible research](http://www.nature.com/news/reproducibility-1.17552).  

I am also comfortable in interfacing with hardware (in my lab I am responsible for maintaining the proper functioning of the spinning disk confocal microscope platform). With my engineering background I am able to handle the electronics, mechanical and computational issues that regularly crop up in my project.
