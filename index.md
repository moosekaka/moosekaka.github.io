## Introduction

I am a recent PhD graduate in Biomedical Engineering and am currently working as an Assistant Specialist in the lab of [Susanne Rafelski](http://www.rafelski.com/susanne/Home.html), [University of California, Irvine](http://uci.edu) where I did my doctoral research. This website is intended as a hub to showcase my research and production code.

My PhD research was focused on creating a framework to study structure and function relationships in budding yeast. I implemented my project using mainly Python, together with commonly used scientific packages available in this language (such as Numpy, Scipy, Pandas etc.).  

My email and contact info are in my [github repo](https://github.com/moosekaka). My most active repository is [this one](https://github.com/moosekaka/sweepython).

You can download a PDF of my thesis [here]({{ site.github.url }}/thesis/thesis.pdf). If you wish, you can also compile from source in Xetex [here](https://github.com/moosekaka/thesis).
